        <h1 id="justification">Environmental Sustainability—necessary for survival</h1> 
        <p>Environmental sustainability is one of the biggest issues faced by the mankind at present. Increasing population along with tremendous escalation
            in anthropogenic activities has raised several questions on the sustainability of natural resources on our planet. No part of the Earth is now 
            untouched by the effect of human activities or pollution. Ever increasing human population and increment in per capita consumption has put great 
            constraint on the natural resources. In addition to this, urbanization, industrialization and modern agricultural practices have polluted the water
            resources, air and soil all around the globe. The natural resources are thus not only being over-exploited but also becoming contaminated with
            toxic chemicals making it difficult for the survival of future generations.

            The ever increasing emission of green house gases is showing far reaching impact on the blue planet and according to estimates of various agencies
            such as United States Development Authority (USDA) and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) this will result in rise in 
            temperature by 02 °C by 2050. This has and will further change the face of the earth. Due to the impact of global warming, glaciers and polar ice
            is melting at rates 2–3 times higher in comparison to last century. According to estimates, Earth at present is going through one of the biggest 
            biodiversity loss phase, the impact of which is unforeseen and unpredictable. As per a United Nations report the human-caused rate of extinction
            of species of both plants and animals at present is hundreds of times higher than the natural rate in the past and as the situation is turning 
            out it can be thousands of times higher in near future. As an example it is estimated that the rate at which coral reefs are depleting, they will
            be completely wiped out in very near future and with them several other species will also become extinct.

            Targeting short term gains, humans have destroyed the natural systems with great pace. But it is difficult to estimate the impact of anthropogenic 
            activities on ecology, in term of economics and even the survivability rate of different life forms on Earth. Although the technology has also 
            advanced at a great pace but still we have hungry people who do not get enough calories to grow normally or even survive. We have issues of availability 
            of potable water, pure air to breathe and ever increasing problem of land degradation. Saline soils are going to increase by 50% up to 2050 and land degradation
            has affected almost every country of the world. Human population is going to produce 27 billion tones of municipal solid waste by 2050 which would require great 
            input of technology to manage and role of microorganisms will be immense. Amount of non-degradable wastes is increasing by the minute and some of the dangerous 
            recalcitrants are accumulating in the food chains and are the cause of contamination of natural resources and extinction of species apart from causing harm to the
            humans. As per recent report published in Scientific Reports a mass of plastic waste named as “Great Pacific Garbage Patch” approximately 1.6 million km2 in
            size ~ twice the size of Texas, is floating on the surface of Pacific ocean. Plastics are also accumulating on land and in water bodies at an unprecedented
            rate and we need to find a quick alternative for these harmful creations of humans.
